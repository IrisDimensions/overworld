VOLMIT SOFTWARE PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 1.1, 24 February 2021

Copyright :copyright: 2021 Andrew Baker


Preamble

After a long and arduous conversation with a former Volmit Software developer, it has become clear that it is no longer viable to keep Volmit repositories under the WTFPL license.
Because of this, we have developed our own software license for our public repositories. You may not be able to do "WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT TO," as per the WTFPL, but you will still have a large amount of leniency over what you can do with Volmit repositories.
